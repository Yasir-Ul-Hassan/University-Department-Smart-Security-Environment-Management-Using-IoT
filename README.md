# University-Department-Smart-Security-Environment-Management-Using-IoT
I developed a smart university department security and automation system using IoT and networking in Cisco Packet Tracer. I implemented RFID-based entry control, smart surveillance, fire safety automation, and smart environment control to prevent unauthorized access and improve safety and energy efficiency.
